<p>By default Xdebug overloads var_dump() with its own improved version
		for displaying variables when the <a href='https://www.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.html-errors'>html_errors</a> php.ini setting is set to
		<code>true</code>. In case you do not want that, you can
		set this setting to <code>0</code>, but check first if it's not smarter
		to turn off <code>html_errors</code>.</p>
		<p><em>New in Xdebug 2.3</em>: You can also use <code>2</code> as value for this setting. Besides
		formatting the var_dump() output nicely, it will also add filename and
		line number to the output. The [CFG:file_link_format] setting is also
		respected.</p>
		<p><em>Before Xdebug 2.4</em>: the default value of this setting was
		<code>1</code>.</p>
