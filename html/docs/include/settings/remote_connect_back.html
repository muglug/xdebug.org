<p>If enabled, the [CFG:remote_host] setting is ignored and Xdebug will
try to connect to the client that made the HTTP request. It checks the
$_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'] and $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] variables to
find out which IP address to use.</p>
<p>If [CFG:remote_addr_header] is configured, then the $SERVER variable with
the configured name will be checked before the
$_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'] and $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] variables.</p>
<p>This setting does not apply for debugging through the CLI, as the $SERVER
header variables are not available there.</p>
<p>Please note that there is <strong>no</strong> filter
available, and anybody who can connect to the webserver will then be able to
start a debugging session, even if their address does not match
[CFG:remote_host].</p>
