<p>This setting can be used to restrict who can make use of the
XDEBUG_TRACE functionality as outlined in [CFG:trace_enable_trigger]. When
changed from its default value of an empty string, the value of the cookie,
GET or POST argument needs to match the shared secret set with this setting in
order for the trace file to be generated.</p>
