<p>Controls whether Xdebug should enforce 'extended_info' mode for the PHP
parser; this allows Xdebug to do file/line breakpoints with the remote
debugger. When tracing or profiling scripts you generally want to turn off this
option as PHP's generated oparrays will increase with about a third of the size
slowing down your scripts. This setting can not be set in your scripts with
ini_set(), but only in php.ini.</p>
