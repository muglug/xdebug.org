<p>Normally you need to use a specific HTTP GET/POST variable to start
remote debugging (see [FEAT:remote#browser_session]). When
this setting is set to 1, Xdebug will always attempt to start a remote
debugging session and try to connect to a client, even if the GET/POST/COOKIE
variable was not present.</p>
