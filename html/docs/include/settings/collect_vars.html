<p>This setting tells Xdebug to gather information about which variables
are used in a certain scope. This analysis can be quite slow as Xdebug has
to reverse engineer PHP's opcode arrays. This setting will not record which
values the different variables have, for that use [CFG:collect_params].
This setting needs to be enabled only if you wish to use
[FUNC:xdebug_get_declared_vars].</p>
